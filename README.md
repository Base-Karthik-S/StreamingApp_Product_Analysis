Decline in Ratings of a Streaming App

## Problem Statement
BingHive is a streaming platform like Netflix, which allows its users to watch series and movies.

It released an update nearly two months ago. Since then users have been reporting issues with "search" functionality and leaving behind negative reviews.

The result? BingHive ratings fell substantially.

## Insights

### Search Functionality:
Questions:
1. In what percent of sessions is search being used? (Consider a sequence of activities done by a user without a 10-minute break between any two activities as one
   session. If there's a gap of more than 10 minutes between a new activity and previous activity, consider the new activity to be in a new session.)
2. Are users able to find what they search for?
3. Does the ordering algorithm of search results need tuning? In other words, do users have to scroll to the bottom to find what they seek?
4. Are users able to search at all? Is the search button working fine?
5. Do users face any errors after running a search query?
6. Are the autocomplete suggestions helpful for users?

Answers:
1. In 45.28% of sessions, search is being used.
